    "A normal distribution has these properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The mean, median, and mode are equal.\n",
    "2. The normal curve is bell-shaped and is symmetric about the mean.\n",
    "3. The total area under the normal curve is equal to 1.\n",
    "4. The normal curve approaches, but never touches, the $x$-axis as it extends farther and farther away from the mean\n",
    "5. Between $\\mu - \\sigma$ and $\\mu + \\sigma$ (in the center of the curve), the graph curves downward.<br/> The graph curves upward to the left of $\\mu - \\sigma$ and to the right of $\\mu + \\sigma$.<br/> The points at which the curve changes from curving upward to curving downward are called **inflection points**."
